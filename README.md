# traffic-datasets

This repository contains a collection of the most frequently used datasets for traffic forecasting. 

Multiple authors and open-source projects provide access to these datasets. One issue is the lack of consistency and the deprecated ways in which these datasets were stored initially. 

To address this issue, this repository aims to provide consistent, modern, ready-to-go access to the most used datasets in the traffic forecasting literature.
